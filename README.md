Henlo, I guess now I've got a hint of what responsivness is. But there are still some inadequacies as you can see. Like ,my image is not fully occupying flexbox, and in smaller viewports my font doesn't seem to completely match with deisgn we were provided with. Aprt form all that , I dont think I'm  lacking anywhere else, but please feel free to comment on my project if you feel there is some scope of improvement.
